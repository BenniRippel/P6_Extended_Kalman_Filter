# Extended Kalman Filter Project 
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project, I built an Extended Kalman Filter in c++ to fuse sensor data from 2 sources:

- LIDAR Sensor
- RADAR Sensor


There are sample data files in the /data folder.

Run the EKF in a terminal entering:

./ExtendedKF /input/data/file /output/data/file
